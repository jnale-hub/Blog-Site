Last week, I had an encounter with a classmate who was using ChatGPT, an advanced language model powered by artificial intelligence. I caught him using it on his phone, and I got so excited because it felt like we were sharing one of the world's best-kept secrets. I could tell he understood the potential of this technology.

Let me give you some background. I'm a freshman at a small community college in our town, and I've been using ChatGPT mostly for fun. Whether I need help with research, writing essays or emails, or even coding assistance, ChatGPT has been a huge help. I discovered it through a TikTok video in December, and since then, I've been using it to my advantage. As someone studying coding and aspiring to be a software engineer, it has been an invaluable tool.

This incident made me realize that very few people in my school are aware of ChatGPT's existence. Nobody seems to be talking about it at school, and whenever I try to introduce it, I fail to generate interest. Even when I explain that ChatGPT can do almost anything, my classmates don't seem interested in learning more.

In fact, the lack of discussions about ChatGPT and artificial intelligence is not limited to my class; it extends to the Philippines as a whole. On platforms like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok, people from other countries are actively discussing it, but in the Philippines, I come across only a small number of news articles about it. Filipinos seem more interested in talking about things like the latest music video of Toni Fowler rather than the emergence of artificial intelligence and new technologies that will shape our future.

Here are some possible reasons why fewer Filipinos are talking about ChatGPT and artificial intelligence in general:

#### 1. Limited internet access and technology adoption

Although most people in school have cellphones, not everyone has access to the internet, and even if they do, it's often limited to platforms like Facebook or TikTok. This lack of internet access and limited exposure to other platforms make it difficult for ChatGPT and AI to gain the attention they deserve. Moreover, the algorithms used by these platforms may vary from user to user, further limiting exposure.

#### 2. Low computer literacy rates

According to an article from the Manila Bulletin, as of 2019, only 6% of Filipinos aged 15 and above possess basic internet skills, while a mere 2% have standard digital skills. Less than 1% have advanced digital skills. These statistics are disheartening considering we live in a digital age where computer literacy is crucial. However, I have seen some improvements since then, and I remain hopeful that our education department will work towards enhancing these numbers.

#### 3. Inadequate government involvement

Unlike other countries, the Philippine government has not actively promoted or integrated artificial intelligence into legislation or policies. This lack of official support and investment in the technology industry hampers awareness and adoption among the general public.

#### 4. Limited awareness among educators

Many educators and instructors in the Philippines are unaware of ChatGPT and its capabilities. Even if students like myself utilize AI-generated essays or content, most teachers assume it was copied from other articles or not even at all. This lack of knowledge and recognition from educators diminishes conversations about AI in educational institutions.

#### 5. Gatekeeping by those who know

On a more personal level, some individuals, including myself, have a tendency to gatekeep ChatGPT because it feels like a power we hold over our classmates who are unaware of this technology. This reluctance to share information restricts the growth of AI discussions.

But why do I want Filipinos to talk about artificial intelligence? Personally, I believe that it has tremendous potential for learners and can simplify various tasks. If our country embraces AI, progress and innovation will improve in various aspects, such as the economy, technology adoption, and career growth. The benefits are endless. However, I'm also aware of the potential risks and disadvantages, which is why I want people to discuss it more. The world is rapidly changing, and as a country, we need to be aware of it.

By addressing the barriers mentioned above and fostering conversations about ChatGPT and artificial intelligence, we can unlock new opportunities for Filipinos, prepare our people for the future, and contribute to the advancement of our nation.
